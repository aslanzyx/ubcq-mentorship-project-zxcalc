# ubcq-mentorship-project-zxcalc
The mentorship project repo for UBC Quantum Club in 2022. The project is about simulating unitary circuit using ZX-calculus.

## Learning Period
- Until June 20:
  - We are refreshing the basic in the first 10 days. Many of the following algorithm might be familiar to you. You can find very detailed introduction with the qiskit textbook: https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html. specifically for the hidden shift circuit. I suggest you to check section 2 and 3 in the paper I listed there. I am pretty sure you can find lots of video lectures on youtube for most of algorithms listed. I will record some video over the weekend for hidden shift circuit.
